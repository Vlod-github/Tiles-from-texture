# Tiles from texture

The process of creating the tileset will consist of the following steps:
1. Seamless texture
2. Boundary tiles
3. Variability
Before you start, you have to choose a texture. This can be either a large image of any shape from which you will cut a square, or a ready-made square downloaded from the Internet. As an example I will take a couple of textures generated by a neural network. The resulting square should be 124x124 pixels.

## Seamless texture
To create a seamless texture, watch the following zen.yandex video. There are 2 steps. First the author enlarges the texture to a square, this may come in handy if you need to increase the frequency of the pattern on the tileset. Then makes it seamless starting with the shift tool (08.08). You can also use your existing texture or reflected variants to caulk the seams.

To check, increase the size of the canvas, multiply the layer with a seamless texture (several times ctrl+j), place the squares next to each other, no lines should be visible.

Before we continue, we need to enlarge the tiles from 124x124 to 128x128, as shown below. The reason is that the 2 outermost pixels are superimposed on the neighboring tile.

## Boundary tiles

There are several ways, the easiest and most complicated is to do it manually, I will do with masks and color selection.
First, you have to select the tileset you want to transition in yourself. Then select the pixels via ctrl+click on the layer, invert and create a black image from the transparent pixels.

Using a common mask is 16 slots faster, but you can erase something superfluous. To make it visually convenient to arrange the bounding tiles, you can use a checkerboard image.

## Variability
We achieve the same way as we smoothed the border of the texture, using a stamp.

## Result
We got an image 512x512 or 512x1024, if you added a variation of the central tile. Convert the image into .tga or .blp format and add to the path of the standard replacement tile, for example, *TerrainArt\LordaeronSummer\Lords_Rock.tga*

In classic WC3, the BLP size is limited to 512. That is, you should use 512x512 or 256x512. If it is larger, the texture will be blurred.
If the weight of the map does not bother, you can use TGA with sizes higher.

Now you can add whatever texture you want to the game.
